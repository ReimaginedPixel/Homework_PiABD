## Database Design and Administration

This repository contains all the projects I have created for the **Database Design and Administration** class. Feel free to draw inspiration or use the code in your own projects. I am currently learning **SQL** and **VBA** and plan to deepen my knowledge in database management.

## Contents
Each folder contains a separate project I have worked on during the class. I will gradually add new projects to showcase my progress in learning.

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
- **SQL** â€“ The main language used in the projects. I focus on database design, queries, and optimization.
- **VBA** â€“ Used for automating database-related tasks and integrating with Microsoft Access and Excel.

## Learning Goals
- Improve my SQL skills and learn advanced query optimization techniques.
- Use VBA for database automation and reporting.

## Contribution & Open Source
